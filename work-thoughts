Hello, this is the start of a new project for create a brand new role-play system 
The basis of this project will be create:
  -Character basis
    -NPCs
    -Player
  -Character habilities:
    -Distributed:
      -Physics
      -Intelligence
      -Charisma
      -Dexterity
      -And more to think.
    
Also a character will have different kinds of features like:
  -Status:
      -Wealth
      -Sickness
      -Mental Health.
      -Scars
      -...
      
How this will affect. The characteristic will be boosted or weaken depending on the status characteristics.
  Ex: A physical hability like climb will be determinated by the strength of the character, but also with is status. how sick he is,
  or maybe if he is hurt or bleeding, poisoned, etc.
